Assignment 1: Research Topic Proposal

Part of the course material the professors added were five datasets, each addressing different topics. The dataset that interested
me the most was that of the Gapminder, which collects data metrics for different countries to see how their performance measures up
to the United Nations Millenium Development Goals. 

For this project, I would like to look into the correlation between internet usage and income per person and employment rate. 
I got a lot of benefits from my access to (free!!!!) online resources. I don't think I would've survived my college education 
without its help, and plenty of the skills I self-learned from it certainly got me farther in both my thesis and personal life. As 
such, I want to see whether access to internet is a big ingredient to social mobility. 

I've added, as part of my personal code book, the following variables:

| Variable Name | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|
|Internetuserate|2010 Internet users (per 100 people)- Internet users are people with access to the worldwide network.|World Bank|
|incomeperperson|"2010 Gross Domestic Product per capita in constant 2000 US$. The inflation but not the differences in the cost of living between countries has been taken into account."|World Bank Work Development Indicators|
|employrate|2007 total employees age 15+ (% of population)- Percentage of total population, age above 15, that has been employed during the given year.|International Labour Organization|
